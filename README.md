# Game-of-Life
Here I explore several implementations of Conway's Game Of Life and compare their efficiency.

I draw on ideas from graph theory and convolution theory. The functions are flexible enough to
be imported and used for other applications.

The reposotory contains two implimentation one in python and an other in cpp, as well as a jupyter notebook explaing some of the concepts.

## python:

The python script produces an animation by runing the following command in the local directory:


```console
python python game_of_life.py -i 'pento' -d 128 -s 10000

```

game_of_life.py:  if run as main produces an animation.

game_of_life.cpp: run and compile for an animation directly in your command line.

Check out the jupyter notebook to make more sense of things.
