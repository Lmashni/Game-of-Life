# Game-of-Life
Here I explore several implementations of Conway's Game Of Life and compare their efficiency.

I draw on ideas from graph theory and convolution theory. The functions are flexible enough to
be imported and used for other applications.

game_of_life.py:  if run as main produces an animation.

game_of_life.cpp: run and compile for an animation directly in your command line.

Check out the jupyter notebook to make more sense of things.
