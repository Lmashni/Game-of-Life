# Game-of-Life
Here I explore several implementations of Conway's Game Of Life and compare their efficiency. 

I draw on ideas from graph theory and convolution theory. The functions are flexible enough to
be imported and used for other applications. 

run the game_of_life.py for a quick animation.

Comiple and run game_of_life.cpp for an animation directly in you command line. 

Then check outÂ the jupyter notebook to make more sense of things.
